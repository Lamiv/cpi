2. How does SAP CPI support the **Pipes & Filters** integration pattern?  
3. What is the **Splitter pattern**, and when should you use it in CPI?  
4. How does the **Aggregator pattern** help in message processing?  
5. What is the **Resequencer pattern**, and how do you implement it in CPI?

## ðŸ”¹ **Hybrid Cloud & On-Premise Integration Strategies**  
6. What are the challenges of **hybrid cloud integrations**, and how does SAP CPI address them?  
7. How does the **SAP Cloud Connector** facilitate on-premise integrations?  
8. What is the role of **Edge Integration Cell** in SAP CPI for hybrid deployments?  
9. How do you handle **network latency and data synchronization** in hybrid integration scenarios?  
10. What are the best practices for ensuring **high availability and failover** in a hybrid integration architecture?  

## ðŸ”¹ **API-First vs. Event-Driven Architectures**  
11. What is the difference between **API-first and event-driven integrations** in SAP CPI?  
12. How does **SAP Event Mesh** enable event-driven architecture?  
13. What is the **Event Choreography pattern**, and how does it improve integration resilience?  
14. How does SAP CPI support **asynchronous event processing**?  
15. When should you use **Event Mesh vs. JMS Queues** for event-driven integration?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Message Processing & Performance Optimization**  
16. How does **Parallel Processing** work?  
17. What is the **Message Store pattern**, and when should it be used?  
18. How do you optimize **message transformations (Groovy/XSLT) in CPI** for better performance?  
19. How do you implement **Backpressure handling** in event-driven integrations?  
20. What are the best strategies to **reduce latency in API-based integrations**?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Real-World Scenarios & Expert-Level Design Considerations**  
21. **Scenario:** A business requires real-time API interactions and minimal latency. Would you recommend an **API-first** or **event-driven** approach?  
22. **Scenario:** A customer has multiple SAP and non-SAP systems and wants to implement a **centralized event hub**. How would you design this using CPI and Event Mesh?  
23. **Scenario:** Your integration needs to process **high-volume transactional data**. How do you ensure that the system scales efficiently?  
24. **Scenario:** Your SAP CPI flow needs to handle **multi-region deployments** with failover capabilities. What architectural patterns would you use?  
25. **Scenario:** How would you design a **serverless integration model** using SAP CPI and SAP BTP services?
