# ðŸ“Œ **Exception Handling & Monitoring in SAP CPI**  

## ðŸ”¹ **Core Exception Handling in SAP CPI**  
1. What are the different types of **errors and exceptions** in SAP CPI?  
2. What is the **difference between synchronous and asynchronous error handling**?  
3. How do you implement **Exception Subprocesses** in an iFlow?  
4. What are the best practices for **error propagation in CPI**?  
5. How do you configure **fault messages for SOAP-based integrations**?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Retry & Fault Handling Mechanisms**  
6. What is the **Retry Pattern**, and how do you implement it in SAP CPI?  
7. How do you handle **temporary API failures** in CPI?  
8. What is the role of **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)** in fault tolerance?  
9. How do you configure a **backup API call** in case the primary API fails?  
10. How does the **Circuit Breaker Pattern** help in resilient integrations?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Message Logging, Debugging & Monitoring**  
11. What is the **Message Processing Log (MPL)**, and how do you analyze it?  
12. How do you enable **Trace Mode** in CPI, and what are its limitations?  
13. How does SAP CPI support **Custom Logging & Audit Trails**?  
14. What is the purpose of **Persist Message function** in monitoring?  
15. How do you generate **custom error alerts and notifications** in CPI?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Security & Compliance in Error Handling**  
16. How do you prevent **exposing sensitive data in error logs**?  
17. What is the **best approach for handling authentication failures** in CPI?  
18. How do you implement **access control for message monitoring**?  
19. How can you mask **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** in CPI logs?  
20. What are the recommended security practices for **log retention and purging**?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Real-World Scenarios & Best Practices**  
21. **Scenario:** A critical integration is failing randomly due to external API timeouts. How do you diagnose and fix the issue?  
22. **Scenario:** Your iFlow is stuck in a retry loop, continuously failing. How do you resolve this?  
23. **Scenario:** A business needs **custom alerts** when certain types of messages fail. How do you implement this?  
24. **Scenario:** How do you ensure **zero message loss** in a high-volume processing scenario?  
25. **Scenario:** Your customer demands **audit logs for compliance reporting**. How do you design your error-handling mechanism to meet this requirement?
