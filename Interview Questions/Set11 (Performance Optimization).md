# ðŸ“Œ **Performance Optimization & Best Practices in SAP CPI**  

## ðŸ”¹ **Core Concepts of Performance Optimization**  
1. What are the key **performance challenges** in SAP CPI integrations?  
2. How do you reduce **latency in API-based integrations**?  
3. What are the best practices for **minimizing message processing time**?  
4. How does **parallel processing** improve CPI performance?  
5. What is the impact of **synchronous vs. asynchronous processing** on performance?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Handling Large Payloads & High-Volume Processing**  
6. What are the best strategies for handling **large XML/JSON payloads** in CPI?  
7. How do you implement **batch processing** in SAP CPI?  
8. How does the **Streaming Pattern** help optimize large message processing?  
9. How do you use **pagination techniques** when fetching large datasets from APIs?  
10. What is the **Chunk Processing Pattern**, and how does it improve scalability?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Optimizing Message Mappings & Transformations**  
11. How do you improve **performance in Graphical Message Mapping**?  
12. What are the best practices for **efficient XSLT transformations**?  
13. How do you optimize **Groovy scripting** for message processing?  
14. When should you use **Value Mapping vs. Lookup Tables** for better performance?  
15. How does **XPath evaluation impact processing speed** in CPI?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Queue Management & Asynchronous Processing**  
16. How does **JMS queuing** help with performance optimization in CPI?  
17. What is the **best way to implement message prioritization** in a queue-based system?  
18. How do you configure **retry mechanisms without causing performance overhead**?  
19. What are the benefits of **SAP Event Mesh for scalable integrations**?  
20. How do you handle **backpressure in an event-driven CPI architecture**?  

## ðŸ”¹ **Real-World Scenarios & Best Practices**  
21. **Scenario:** A CPI iFlow is running slow due to complex message transformations. How do you improve its performance?  
22. **Scenario:** An integration must process **100,000 records per hour** without failure. What optimizations would you apply?  
23. **Scenario:** Your customer is experiencing high API response times in CPI. How do you diagnose and fix this issue?  
24. **Scenario:** How do you optimize CPI memory consumption when handling **high-throughput transactions**?  
25. **Scenario:** A partner API has strict **rate limits** on requests. How do you ensure CPI does not exceed these limits?
